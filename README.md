# [CSharp Fundamentals - may 2020 Course](https://softuni.bg/trainings/2830/csharp-fundamentals-may-2020)

------------

This is the second course I completed at SoftUni. It is a continuation of Programming Basics. Here you can find my solutions of all problems (mandatory and optional) from the course. Every solution is tested at SoftUni Judge System with result 100/100. The tasks are sorted by lectures. Also here there are all exam problems from older editions of the course.
